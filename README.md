# Final Project Guidelines:

•	[2020-02-02] Please choose two papers (one as the main and one as your backup) for your presentation from the following conferences: ICSE 2019, ISSTA 2019, FSE 2019, USENIX 2019, ICST 2019. 

•	[2020-04-14] Project Presentation Schedule. It's the same as the paper presentation. We will have up to two presentations per day.

•	[2020-04-20] Some students asked about project report. This semester has presented difficulties for everyone, so I am relaxing the project requirement: there is no need for a report. Your presentation is sufficient.

# Result and Analysis:

We studied the paper [Testing Machine Learning Algorithms for Balanced Data Usage](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730187) in this project. We *adopted* the analysis slightly and implemented the code by ourselves. See below for summary:
